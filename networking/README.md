### Abstract

We present our experience with QUIC, an encrypted, multiplexed,
and low-latency transport protocol designed from the ground up to
improve transport performance for HTTPS traffic and to enable rapid
deployment and continued evolution of transport mechanisms. QUIC
has been globally deployed at Google on thousands of servers and
is used to serve traffic to a range of clients including a widely-used
web browser (Chrome) and a popular mobile video streaming app
(YouTube). We estimate that 7% of Internet traffic is now QUIC. We
describe our motivations for developing a new transport, the princi-
ples that guided our design, the Internet-scale process that we used
to perform iterative experiments on QUIC, performance improve-
ments seen by our various services, and our experience deploying
QUIC globally. We also share lessons about transport design and the
Internet ecosystem that we learned from our deployment.
